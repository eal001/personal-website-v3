# Personal Website V3 #
A third iteration on my personal website utilizing the principles I learned over my summer intern experience and in my Software Engineering Class at UCSD. I will make an attemt to simplify the process of creating this website and minimize the dependencies needed to produce the website. I will not be managing a team for this website, so I plan to commit directly to dev and merge only to a main 'prod' version!

## Getting Started ##
With this repo, I am using npm as a package manager, specifically version 8.19.2.
I order to install dependecies run the following command at the root of this repo:
```
npm install
```
and to run locally open ```index.html``` on a local port!

## Whats Next ##
these are mostly notes to myself so that i rememebr what i wanted to add in next
1. transitions so that the movement betqween pages isnt too clunky
2. a set of videos on the about page, that is generated randomly much like the icons (keep this responsive)
